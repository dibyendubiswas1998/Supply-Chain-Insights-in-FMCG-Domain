# Supply Chain Insights (FMCG Domain):
AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodara. 
They want to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities in the next 2 years.<br>

* AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. 
* It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, 
	which could have resulted in bad customer service. 
 * Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their 
	supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers daily basis so that they can 
	respond swiftly to these issues.
